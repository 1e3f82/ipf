Title: IHE QRPH Guideline Schematron Package

Description: This package contains the schematron rules for validating XML documents against guidelines specified by the IHE Quality, Research and Public Health (QRPH) Technical Framework.  Please note that these schematron files check for conformance against IHE QRPH rules only.

Schematron for CCD and CDA4CDT can be downloaded from the HL7 Wiki (http://wiki.hl7.org/).
